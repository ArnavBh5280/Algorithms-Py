# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository (Python)

This repository is a structured collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Python**. Its purpose is to provide clear, practical examples of fundamental computer science concepts, complemented by explanatory notes.

## What's Inside?

* **Python Implementations:** You will find well-commented Python code for a wide array of data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs) and algorithms (including various sorting, searching, and dynamic programming techniques).

* **Concise Notes:** Each implementation is often accompanied by short, digestible notes. These notes aim to clarify the theoretical basis, typical applications, and key characteristics of the particular data structure or algorithm.

* **Complexity Analysis:** We provide analyses of time and space complexity to help you understand the performance implications of each algorithm.

* **Illustrative Examples:** Most implementations include small, self-contained examples to demonstrate their usage and expected behavior.

## Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as a personal knowledge base, aiming to solidify understanding of DSA through hands-on coding and systematic documentation. It is designed to be:

* **A Learning Resource:** Beneficial for individuals studying data structures and algorithms, offering practical code examples to complement theoretical learning.

* **A Reference Guide:** A readily accessible compendium for reviewing specific algorithms or data structures.

* **A Practice Environment:** Provides a foundation for extending and experimenting with algorithmic implementations.
